Green Pool is a online platform for recycling collaboration.

Basically, it's an Uber for recycling ( *sigh* we know, but this is the easiset way to get the point across).

You can get a really good idea about how the app works and see us in this video here...

Green Pool was built on Ruby on Rails 5 with Ruby version 2.4.1

It uses a PostgresSQL database.

Profile Pictures are stored in an AWS Bucket.

The UI uses the Bootstrap framework along with Javascript for animations (Mostly the cool wave on the homepage).

Text notifications to users are made possible by Twillio.

The app is deployed using Heroku on gogreepool.co

Testing for the app uses the Capybara framework.
